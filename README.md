## Unsupervised -Clustering algorithm for Customer Segmentation

### Introduction
Imagine if you own a shop/super-market, there is an opportunity to know customer behaviour. So with this power what you gonna do? Offers, boosting your sales and income etc.

Lots of food for thought, but its possible.
The question is How? through Machine Learning ya a bit technical but ignore if you belong to non technical and you can hire them.
 
Knowing your Customer definately helps in your buisiness if you have the data then you have the insights which helps in your buisiness with many ways. 

#for tech-person  
As we know, Machine learning comes in handy for this task. Particularly, clustering, one of the important unsupervised learning problem, is able to create categories grouping similar individuals.  
Note: Here Data is not labelled, so we create clusters
  
Categories also knowns as clusters which is a collection of points in a dataset. These points are more similar between them than they are to points belonging to other clusters.
Distance-based clustering groups the points into some number of clusters such that distances within the cluster should be small while distances between clusters should be large.  
  
  ## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
  
1) Perform EDA on the dataset.
2) Check that the assumptions K-means makes are fulfilled.
3) Apply K-means clustering algorithm in order to segment customers.


## Tools used and Analysis


The whole analysis was done using JupyterLab and Python, using libraries such as: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

This repo contains two files:

- `clustering_analysis.ipybn`: In this jupyter notebook, exploratory data analysis is performed. Moreover, the algorithm assumptions are checked. K-means is applied to segment customers obtaining a graph and the customer segments. It is also shown how to predict to which segment a new customers belongs to.

- `customers.csv` dataset used to perform the analysis.
